This is a simple in-memory database inspired by Redis.<br>
It includes HashMap and SortedSet containers (possibly more to come).

## Features
- **Containers**: Can store both key-value pairs and ordered sets of data.
- **HashMap**: Efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs.
- **SortedSet**: Maintain a sorted collection of unique elements.
- **CLI**: Easily interact with the database using the command line interface.
- **Client-Server Communication**: Enable communication between clients and a server for distributed data management.
